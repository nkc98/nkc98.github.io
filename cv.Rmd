**hit the link above for the .pdf version of my cv.**

my professional background centers around providing quality research and advisory services to governments and organizations in the area of climate finance and policy. over the course of this work, i've occupied a number of different roles, making contributions as a policy researcher, financial analyst, and data engineer.

in general, i work best when focusing my efforts on structured problem solving, ranging from building out a financial model with sensitivities to coding a data pipeline to simply filling out a storyboard for a report. usually this involves collaboration with a team, which i think is necessary to coming up with good solutions!

when i am not working on solving problems directly, i also enjoy teaching. as a graduate student, i've worked as an assistant instructor for a course on energy systems, technology, and markets, and another course on quantitative research methods using R.

my professional background centers around providing quality research and advisory services to governments and organizations in the area of climate finance and policy. throughout this work, i have occupied a variety of different roles â€” making contributions as a policy researcher, financial analyst, and data engineer, often at the same time!

in general, i work best when focusing my efforts on structured problem solving, which can range from building out sensitivities for a financial model to coding a data pipeline to simply mapping out a storyboard for a report. usually this involves collaboration with a team, which i think is necessary to coming up with good solutions!

when i am not working on solving problems directly, i also enjoy teaching. as a graduate student, i have been an assistant instructor for a course on energy systems, technology, and markets, as well as another course on quantitative research methods using R.

**hit the link above for the .pdf version of my cv.**

my professional background is largely centered around providing quality research and advisory services in the area of climate finance and policy to governments and organizations. through this work, i've occupied a number of different roles, making contributions as a policy researcher, financial analyst, data engineer, and econometrician.

in general, i work best when focusing my efforts on structured problem solving. this can range from building out a financial model with sensitivities to coding a data pipeline to simply filling out a storyboard for a report. usually this involves collaboration with a team, which i think is necessary to coming up with good solutions!

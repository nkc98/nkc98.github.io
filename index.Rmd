#### some highlights:
<br/>

##### I. tracking and analyzing the climate commitments of public financial institutions
[Climate Policy Initiative](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/public-financial-institutions-climate-commitments/)
<br/>
public FIs are an instrumental part of the global financial system's response to the climate finance gap. my colleagues and i examine the commitments made by these institutions towards financing climate projects and decarbonizing their portfolios.
<br/>
<br/>

##### II. a look at medicaid expansion's effect on the drug overdose epidemic in appalachia
[Graduate School Project](files/U6614_final_project.pdf)
<br/>
initial attempt at identifying a causal linkage between 2014 medicaid expansion and overdose deaths in appalachia. conclusions are sobering but should be taken with sufficient skepticism.

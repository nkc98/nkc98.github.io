#### some recent highlights:
<br/>

##### I. measuring the text content of nationally determined contributions (NDCs)
[Graduate School Project (2023)](files/TAD_final_project.pdf)
<br/>
how do countries talk about their climate priorities? are the critical issues of vulnerability to climate risks and differentiated national responsibilities for climate action actually reflected in national climate documents?
<br/>
<br/>

##### II. tracking and analyzing the climate commitments of public financial institutions
[Climate Policy Initiative (2022)](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/public-financial-institutions-climate-commitments/)
<br/>
public FIs are an instrumental part of the global financial system's response to the climate finance gap. my colleagues and i examine the commitments made by these institutions towards financing climate projects and decarbonizing their portfolios.
<br/>
<br/>

##### III. the effect of medicaid expansion on the drug overdose epidemic in appalachia
[Graduate School Project (2022)](files/U6614_final_project.pdf)
<br/>
initial attempt at identifying a causal linkage between 2014 medicaid expansion and overdose deaths in appalachia. conclusions are sobering but should be taken with sufficient skepticism.

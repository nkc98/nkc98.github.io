#### some recent highlights:
<br/>

##### I. measuring the text content of nationally determined contributions (NDCs)
[Graduate School Project (2023)](files/TAD_final_project.pdf)
<br/>
how do countries talk about their climate priorities? are the critical issues of vulnerability to climate risks and differentiated national responsibilities for climate action actually reflected in national climate documents?
<br/>
<br/>

##### II. enhancing MDB-NDB cooperation
[Climate Policy Initiative & E3G](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/enhancing-mdb-ndb-cooperation-understanding-climate-finance-flows-and-paris-alignment/)
<br/>
looks at the state of climate finance cooperation between multilateral and national development banks. data is novel and collected using a combination of web scraping and text matching.

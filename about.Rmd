i am currently based in San Francisco, where i am a [senior climate finance analyst](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/people/neil-chin-2/) at [climate policy initiative](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/). previously, i completed the master of international affairs (MIA) program at the columbia university school of international and public affairs (SIPA), focusing on energy and environment topics and data science applications.

i am primarily interested in researching, developing, and implementing programs and projects around the globe in the area of climate policy and finance â€” with a focus on international cooperation, economic development, and financial innovation. i do venture into other fields from time to time, some examples of which you may find on here!

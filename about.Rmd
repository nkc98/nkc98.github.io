i am currently based in new york city, where i am a master of international affairs (MIA) student at the columbia university school of international and public affairs (SIPA).

i am primarily interested in researching, developing, and implementing climate policy, programs, and projects on a global scale â€” with a focus on international cooperation, economic development, and climate finance. but i do dabble in other fields, some examples of which you may find on here!

feel free to get in touch with me by email or to connect over social media.
